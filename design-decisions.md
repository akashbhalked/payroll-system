Choice of DB
---
If a project is mission critical it is supposed to implment transcational databases like postgres, mysql etc.
But given the problem and my familarity with existing NoSQL database at work. I would be using MongoDB for this part of implmentation.

Server
---
I would be using Node.js for backend processing of request and sending out response. All langagues and frameworks are equivalent. Other languages/frameworks can complement/replace the existing setup.
